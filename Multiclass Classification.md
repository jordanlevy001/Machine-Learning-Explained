# Supervised Learning: Multiclass Classification

## What is Classification
The classification problem is similar to the regression problem, except that the values we want to predict are a small number of discrete values. Classification can be binary or multiclass/multinomial.

### Multiclass Classification
Multiclass classification involves classifying data when we have more than 2 categories. Instead of y = {0,1} which we use in binary classification, we use y = {0,1,...,n}.
