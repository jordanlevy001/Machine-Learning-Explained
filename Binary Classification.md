# Supervised Learning: Classification

## What is Classification
The classification problem is similar to the regression problem, except that the values we want to predict are a small number of discrete values. Classification can be binary or multiclass/multinomial.

## Binary Classification
In binary classification, y can take on only two values: 0 and 1.

## Binary Classification Hypothesis Function
The hypothesis function is called the "Sigmoid Function" or the "Logistic Function".
