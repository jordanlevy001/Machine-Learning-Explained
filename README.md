# Machine Learning Explained
An overview of machine learning and the mathematics powering machine learning

## Two Types of Machine Learning
1. Unsupervised
2. Supervised

## Unsupervised Learning



## Supervised Learning
Supervised learning can be divided into regression and classification. Regression is used to predict continuous variables. Whereas classification is used to predict discrete outcomes. 

## Regression vs Classification

### Regression
When the target variable to predict is **continuous**, then the learning problem is considered a regression problem.

Supervised learning can be divided into regression and classification. Regression is used to predict continuous variables. Whereas classification is used to predict discrete outcomes. For this wine analysis, the target variable (what we're trying to predict), is a quality score -- which is a continuous variable. The wine quality score is a numerical value within a given range, making it a continuous variable. In both classification and regression issues, the data is divided into features and targets. Features are the variable used to inform the prediction. The target/output is the predicted outcome.

### Classification
When the target variable to predict is **discrete**, then the learning problem is considered a classification problem.


## Cost Function
Using a cost function, we can measure the accuracy of our hypothesis function. This takes an average difference of all the results of the hypothesis with inputs from 'x' and the actual outputs (y).

The cost function, broken down, is 1/2 of the mean of the squares of the difference between the predicted value ( h0(x) ) and the actual value (y).




### Minimizing the Cost Function








## Machine Learning in Practice

Steps to run machine learning:
1. Collect/Gather the data
2. Prepare/Pre-process the data
3. Choose the optimal model
4. Train the model
5. Optimize the model
6. Make predictions
