# Machine Learning Explained
An overview of machine learning and the mathematics powering machine learning

## Two Types of Machine Learning
1. Unsupervised
2. Supervised

## Cost Function
Using a cost function, we can measure the accuracy of our hypothesis function. This takes an average difference of all the results of the hypothesis with inputs from 'x' and the actual outputs (y).

The cost function, broken down, is 1/2 of the mean of the squares of the difference between the predicted value ( h0(x) ) and the actual value (y).




### Minimizing the Cost Function








## Machine Learning in Practice

Steps to run machine learning:
1. Collect/Gather the data
2. Prepare/Pre-process the data
3. Choose the optimal model
4. Train the model
5. Optimize the model
6. Make predictions
